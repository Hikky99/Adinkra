## Introduction

This repository contains a robotic application for object identification, specifically designed to identify and explain the wisdom behind Adinkra symbols. The project was led by Hamza Mohammed, funded by the Goethe-Institut Accra, and managed by Portia Eyram Meli Mansu. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Goethe-Institut, Portia Eyram Meli Mansu, and the Goethe-Institut Library Team for their support and collaboration.

Adinkra symbols are a rich and culturally significant system of visual representation used by the Akan people of West Africa, primarily in Ghana. These symbols convey various messages, proverbs, and philosophical concepts. This robotic application aims to provide a unique and interactive way to learn about these symbols and the wisdom they embody.

## Features

1. **Object Identification**: The core functionality of this application is its ability to identify Adinkra symbols placed in front of the robot's camera.

2. **Symbol Explanation**: Once a symbol is recognized, the robot will provide an explanation of the wisdom or message associated with that particular Adinkra symbol.

## Usage

To use this robotic application, follow these steps:

**I. Prepare the Robot**

- Load the behavior file and the Adinkra symbol database onto Choregraphe.

**II. Build the Application**

- Compile and build the application.

**III. Object Identification**

- Start the application.

**IV. Place Adinkra Symbols**

- Position Adinkra symbols one by one in front of the robot's camera.

**V. Recognition and Explanation**

- The robot will recognize each symbol and verbally provide an explanation of the wisdom behind it.

Please make sure to complete steps I and II before proceeding with object identification. This ensures that the necessary files and the application are loaded and ready for use.
